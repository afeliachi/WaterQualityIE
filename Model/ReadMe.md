# Water Quality IE UML Model
The WQ IE UML Model has been defined based on the OMS Model. The logical model is based on the OMS classes with a few minor additions. The physical model was derived from the OMS based logical model following the STA approach; this work is guiding the current update to STA 2.0.

The WQ IE UML Model has been created within the OGC Sparx Cloud. There are two ways to access this model:
- For simple viewing, see details in the section on [Web Access to OGC Sparx Cloud](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ReadMe.md#web-access-to-ogc-sparx-cloud)
- For downloading the model to a local copy of EA, see details in the section on [Download UML Model to local EA Instance
](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ReadMe.md#download-uml-model-to-local-ea-instance)

Under the WQ IE UML Model, you will find 3 folders:
- Logical Model
- Physical Model
- WaterQuality_Instance

For an overview of these individual folders and their contents, please see the [Package Overview Diagram](https://umltool.ogc.org/index.php?m=7&o=BDD2204B-5E02-44b5-8F54-10A230C2491F) as well as the sections below.

## Logical Model
The [logical model](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/Logical%20Model.md) is based on OMS with minor additions.

## Physical Model
The [physical model](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/Physical%20Model.md) is based on a draft version of the STA 2.0 model currently being created.

## WaterQuality_Instance
During the requirements collection phase, strong use was made of UML Object Diagrams following the OMS standard.


# Access to the WQ IE UML Model
There are various ways to access the WQ IE UML Model hosted on the OGC SparxCloud:
- Web Access to OGC Sparx Cloud
- Download UML Model to local EA Instance
- Direct Access to the OGC Sparx Cloud

## Web Access to OGC Sparx Cloud
The simplest way to view the Water Quality IE UML Model is via the [Web Viewer of the OGC Sparx Cloud](https://umltool.ogc.org/login.php). We've provided a simple tutorial on the use of the [Web Viewer of the OGC Sparx Cloud](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/WebAccess.md).


## Download UML Model to local EA Instance
For those who wish to extend the Water Quality IE UML Model, they must first create a local model in EA and import all the relevant implementation artifacts via the Remote Asset Service (RAS). We've provided a simple tutorial on how to [utilize RAS to create a local model in EA](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ImportEA-Local.md).

## Direct Access to the OGC Sparx Cloud
In order to modify UML within the OGC Sparx Cloud, you must access the Cloud via you're local EA instance, create a cloud connection. We've provided a simple tutorial on how to set up [Direct Access to the OGC Sparx Cloud](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/DirectAccessCloud.md).
