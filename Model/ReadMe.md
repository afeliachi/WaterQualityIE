# Water Quality IE UML Model
The WQ IE UML Model has been created within the OGC Sparx Cloud. There are two ways to access this model:
- For simple viewing, see details in the section on [Web Access to OGC Sparx Cloud](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ReadMe.md#web-access-to-ogc-sparx-cloud)
- For downloading the model to a local copy of EA, see details in the section on [Download UML Model to local EA Instance
](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ReadMe.md#download-uml-model-to-local-ea-instance)

Under the WQ IE UML Model, you will find 3 folders:
- Logical Model
- Physical Model
- WaterQuality_Instance

For an overview of these individual folders and their contents, please see the [Package Overview Diagram](https://umltool.ogc.org/index.php?m=7&o=BDD2204B-5E02-44b5-8F54-10A230C2491F).

## Logical Model
In the logical model, we define an association between WQ_Sampling acts and the relevant WQ_Host objects, that is not foreseen under the OMS Model.

## Physical Model


## WaterQuality_Instance


# Web Access to OGC Sparx Cloud
The simplest way to view the Water Quality IE UML Model is via the [Web Viewer of the OGC Sparx Cloud](https://umltool.ogc.org/login.php). We've provided a simple tutorial on the use of the [Web Viewer of the OGC Sparx Cloud](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/WebAccess.md).


# Download UML Model to local EA Instance
For those who wish to extend the Water Quality IE UML Model, they must first create a local model in EA and import all the relevant implementation artifacts via the Remote Asset Service (RAS). We've provided a simple tutorial on how to [utilize RAS to create a local model in EA](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WaterQualityIE/blob/master/Model/ImportEA-Local.md).
